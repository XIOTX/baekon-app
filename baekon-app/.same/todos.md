# BÆKON App - Current Development Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Chat Panel Merge (Version 43+)

**Major UI Improvement Completed:**
- ✅ **Merged AIResponsePanel and ChatLogPanel into single component**
  - ✅ Changed title from "AI Response" to "BÆKON" as requested
  - ✅ Combined chat log and response into unified experience
  - ✅ Click to expand functionality working properly
  - ✅ Expansion covers sidebar area seamlessly (no popup behavior)
  - ✅ Cal Sans font applied to titles
  - ✅ Syne Mono font applied to chat content
  - ✅ Neon borders and background image overlay consistent
  - ✅ Overlay expands upward to top of sidebar panel
  - ✅ Visual continuity maintained with rest of app

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Single expandable chat component replacing both panels
- ✅ Seamless overlay behavior (not pushing sidebar)
- ✅ Font hierarchy: Cal Sans for titles, Syne Mono for chat
- ✅ Consistent neon-glow styling and background images
- ✅ Proper z-index layering and positioning
- ✅ Removed ChatLogPanel from main app content

## 🚨 URGENT: NextAuth Session Persistence Issue

**Current Problem:**
- ✅ Sign-in succeeds but session fetch fails with `unauthenticated` status
- ❌ Session endpoint `/api/auth/session` has redirect errors despite correct `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- ❌ Session persistence not working - user stays "unauthenticated"

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- NEXTAUTH_URL is correctly set to `https://baekon-app-production-59d0.up.railway.app`
- Prisma adapter temporarily removed (using JWT-only sessions)
- `trustHost: true` added for Railway proxy compatibility
- All redirect logic disabled to isolate router errors

**Current Status:**
- 🟡 **IN_PROGRESS**: Fix NextAuth session endpoint redirect loop
- 🟡 **IN_PROGRESS**: Restore proper session persistence
- 🟡 **IN_PROGRESS**: Debug Railway proxy/cookie issues

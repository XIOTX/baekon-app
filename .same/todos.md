# B√ÜKON App - Current Development Status

## üö® URGENT: NextAuth Session Persistence Issue

**Current Problem:**
- ‚úÖ Sign-in succeeds but session fetch fails with `unauthenticated` status
- ‚ùå Session endpoint `/api/auth/session` has redirect errors despite correct `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- ‚ùå Session persistence not working - user stays "unauthenticated"

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- NEXTAUTH_URL is correctly set to `https://baekon-app-production-59d0.up.railway.app`
- Prisma adapter temporarily removed (using JWT-only sessions)
- `trustHost: true` added for Railway proxy compatibility
- All redirect logic disabled to isolate router errors

**Current Status:**
- üü° **IN_PROGRESS**: Fix NextAuth session endpoint redirect loop
- üü° **IN_PROGRESS**: Restore proper session persistence
- üü° **IN_PROGRESS**: Debug Railway proxy/cookie issues

## üîÑ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### High Priority - Session Fix
- [ ] **Investigate NextAuth middleware configuration**
  - [ ] Check if middleware.ts is interfering with auth routes
  - [ ] Verify auth route matching patterns
  - [ ] Test without any middleware

- [ ] **Test JWT session storage**
  - [ ] Verify JWT tokens are being created during sign-in
  - [ ] Check browser cookies for nextauth tokens
  - [ ] Test session callback execution

- [ ] **Railway-specific auth debugging**
  - [ ] Test auth endpoints directly via curl/Postman
  - [ ] Check Railway logs for session endpoint errors
  - [ ] Verify proxy headers and forwarding

- [ ] **Alternative session approach**
  - [ ] Try different session strategy if JWT fails
  - [ ] Test with minimal NextAuth config
  - [ ] Consider temporary custom session handling

### Medium Priority - After Auth Fixed
- [ ] **Re-enable proper authentication flow**
  - [ ] Restore redirect logic in `ClientBody`
  - [ ] Re-enable session check in main page
  - [ ] Test complete auth workflow

- [ ] **Re-add Prisma adapter (when ready)**
  - [ ] Restore database session storage
  - [ ] Test database connection stability
  - [ ] Verify user persistence

## VERSION 26+ COMPLETED ‚úÖ

**üéØ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

### ‚úÖ **Core System Fixes (Version 26)**
- **Calendar Grid Overflow**: Fixed day cells stretching when too many events added
  - Calendar day cells maintain fixed 120px height
  - Events limited to 3 visible per cell with "more..." indicator
  - Expandable overlay for days with many events
  - Overlay positioned properly without pushing other cells
  - Stable calendar grid layout regardless of event count

- **Voice Network Error Handling**: Enhanced error message specificity
  - Detailed microphone access error detection
  - Improved speech recognition start error handling
  - Network errors show specific "check internet connection" messages
  - Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

- **AI Event Date Parsing Fix**: Fixed AI-created events always defaulting to today
  - Modified `createEvent` function in aiFunctions.ts to return `storageInfo`
  - Frontend handles AI event creation with proper localStorage writing
  - Events created via AI respect natural language date parsing
  - Events appear in correct dates/time slots based on user input

### ‚úÖ **Complete System Documentation**
- **B√ÜKON AI Agent Manual**: Comprehensive 1000+ line documentation
  - System Overview & Architecture
  - Function Reference with complete code examples
  - Storage Patterns & localStorage structure documentation
  - Event Creation Workflows (4 different methods)
  - Memory & Context system with semantic search
  - Error Handling & Recovery patterns
  - Troubleshooting guide with real solutions
  - Voice command integration patterns
  - Natural language processing workflows
  - Best practices for AI agents operating in B√ÜKON

### ‚úÖ **Previous Major Features (Versions 1-25)**
- Complete UI/UX with neon dark theme
- 4-quarter time blocking system (9AM-3PM, 3PM-9PM, 9PM-3AM, 3AM-9AM)
- Advanced voice command system with Web Speech API
- AI function calling with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Persistent memory system with semantic search
- Natural language date/time parsing
- Calendar and planner views with expandable overlays
- localStorage-first data architecture with optional cloud sync
- Activity history tracking and context building
- Bokibo AI personality (operative interface by Brion Aiota/xiotx)

## üöÄ CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**Active Deployment:**
- **Platform**: Railway (auto-deploy from GitHub main branch)
- **URL**: [Production B√ÜKON instance]
- **Version**: 26+ with all fixes applied
- **Status**: ‚ùå Auth Session Issues - Needs immediate fix

**Recent Major Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker Build Syntax Error**: Fixed orphaned code blocks in `aiTools.ts`
  - Removed duplicate code blocks causing compilation errors
  - Fixed break statement outside of loop context
  - Build now completes successfully: `bun run build` ‚úÖ

- üöÄ **REVOLUTIONARY: Calendar Reference System**: Solved AI date confusion
  - Created `calendarReference.ts` - authoritative calendar data source
  - AI now compares dates against browser's actual calendar instead of guessing
  - Added `get_calendar_context` AI function for grounding date operations
  - Enhanced date parsing with external calendar knowledge
  - Removed 150+ lines of unreliable legacy parsing code
  - **IMPACT**: No more "mixed up dates" - AI uses real calendar as ground truth

**Local Development:**
- **Port**: 3000 (localhost:3000)
- **Status**: All systems functional
- **Testing**: Voice commands, AI event creation, calendar UI all working

## üìä SYSTEM HEALTH

**Core Components Status:**
- ‚úÖ Frontend (Next.js): Fully operational
- ‚úÖ Backend APIs: All endpoints working
- ‚úÖ Database (PostgreSQL): Connected and functional
- ‚úÖ AI Integration (OpenAI): Function calling active
- ‚úÖ Voice System: Web Speech API working
- ‚úÖ Memory System: Semantic search operational
- ‚úÖ Storage: localStorage + database sync
- ‚ùå **Authentication**: NextAuth session persistence failing
- ‚úÖ Deployment: Railway auto-deploy active

**Immediate Fixes Needed:**
- NextAuth session endpoint redirect loop
- Session fetch returning `unauthenticated` despite successful sign-in
- Cookie/JWT token persistence on Railway deployment

## üí° NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **localStorage-first**: Privacy-focused data storage with optional cloud sync
- **Function calling**: AI has real control over app features through structured APIs
- **Quarter system**: 6-hour time blocks instead of traditional hourly scheduling
- **Bokibo persona**: Operative interface, not general chatbot personality
- **Progressive enhancement**: Graceful degradation when features unavailable

**Important Files:**
- `/src/lib/aiFunctions.ts` - AI function calling implementation
- `/src/components/SchedulerView.tsx` - Calendar UI with overlay system
- `/src/hooks/useVoiceRecording.ts` - Voice command processing
- `/src/lib/openai.ts` - AI integration and memory system
- `/.same/baekon-manual.md` - Complete system documentation

**Current Debugging Focus:**
1. NextAuth session endpoint redirect resolution
2. Railway proxy header compatibility
3. JWT token creation and persistence
4. Browser cookie storage verification
5. Middleware interference investigation

The B√ÜKON system core functionality is complete but authentication requires immediate attention to restore full functionality.
